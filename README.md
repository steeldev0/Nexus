# Setting up Ghostphones

**To start forking Ghostphones, here's how you can do it:**

1. Installing Python

   **Go to [the official Python website](https://python.org) and download and install Python**
   
3. Downloading the required packages

   **Once you have installed Python, go to your terminal, and run "pip install -r requirements.txt", or "pip3 install -r requirements.txt", or "pip.exe install -r requirements.txt"**

4. Setting Nexus up

   **Now go to .env.example.txt, you should find text saying put your token here, just replace the text with your Discord bot token, make sure message content intent is enabled in the Discord Developer Portal. Then, rename the file to just ".env"**

5. Starting nexus

   **To start Nexus, you run "python3 main.py", then Nexus is fully set up and working!**

**Ghostphones is successfully set up now, if you encounter any problems, text @steeldev on discord or join our [support server](https://discord.gg/mcdK88yUgF) for support!**
**THIS BOT IS A FORKED VERSION OF NEXUS, THIS CODE IS NOT BY ME, SO CREDITS TO @steeldev"
