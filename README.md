# Setting up Nexus

**To start forking Nexus, here's how you can do it:**

1. Installing Python

   **Go to [the official Python website](https://python.org) and download and install Python**
   
3. Downloading the required packages

   **Once you have installed Python, go to your terminal, and run "pip install -r requirements.txt", or "pip3 install -r requirements.txt", or "pip.exe install -r requirements.txt"**

4. Setting Nexus up

   **Now go to token.txt, you should find text saying put your token here, just replace the text with your Discord bot token, make sure message content intent is enabled in the Discord Developer Portal.**

5. Starting nexus

   **To start Nexus, you run "python3 main.py", then Nexus is fully set up and working!**

   **If python3 main.py doesnt work, try py main.py**

**Nexus is successfully set up now, if you encounter any problems, text @steeldev on discord or join our [support server](https://discord.gg/mcdK88yUgF) for support!**
**Be sure to give Nexus credits if you have forked it. Do not mark Nexus forks as your own**
